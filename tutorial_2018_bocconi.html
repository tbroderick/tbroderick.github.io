<h2>Description</h2>

Bayesian methods have a number of desirable properties for modern data analysis---including
coherent quantification of uncertainty, a modular modeling framework that allows a practitioner to capture
complex phenomena, and the ability to incorporate prior information from an expert source.
However, Bayesian inference typically requires a high-dimensional integration, and in most moderately complex
problems, this integration must be approximated. 
This tutorial will introduce variational Bayes (VB) as a tool for approximate
Bayesian inference that can scale to modern data and model sizes. We will discuss the benefits and drawbacks
of variational Bayes in the context of recent research.

<p>A likely collection of topics we will cover includes:
Variational Bayes, mean-field variational Bayes, latent
Dirichlet allocation, stochastic gradient and stochastic variational
inference, streaming and distributed methods, automatic
differentiation and black-box variational inference, linear response
variational Bayes, robustness quantification.
And the seminar will cover new data summarization methods for scalable Bayesian inference
with finite-data theoretical guarantees on quality.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

Basic familiarity with Bayesian data analysis and its goals. Be familiar with the following concepts: priors, likelihoods, posteriors, Bayes Theorem,
and conjugacy (for discrete and continuous distributions).
